`linea` is an R library, designed as an interface to accelerate linear regression modelling and visualization. The library allows users to build complex model specification through custom transformations.

The library can be installed from CRAN using `install.packages('linea')`.

Alternatively, you can install the development version from GitHub using `devtools::install_github('paladinic/linea')`.

The [online guide](https://www.linea-r.org) provides a detailed walkthrough of how to use LINEA.

> **Note:** `linea` is still in alpha and the library may change. Feedback is very welcome but please donâ€™t use it for production applications just yet!
