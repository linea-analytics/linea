## Re-Submission
This is a re-submission. In this re-submitted version I have:

* Used new.env() when using assign() to not modify the .GlobalEnv
* Added a, or adjusted the, @return value for all functions
* Expanded the Description field to better explain the library
* Dropped library name from the Description field
* Replaced T,F with TRUE,FALSE
* Removed class(model) == 'lm'
