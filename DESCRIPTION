Description: An interface to accelerate linear regression (Ordinary least squares) modelling, which
  allows users to build models quickly, while automatically generating interactive visualizations of the results.
  Non-linear models specification (e.g. y = b1*x1 + b2*log(x2)) can be easily constructed using user-defined transformations.
  Functions for testing wide ranges of model specifications (e.g. y = b*log(x,10) , y = b*log(x,20) , ...), all at once, are also available.
  Finally, models can be imported and exported as Excel files where all the information necessary for re-running the models is stored in separate sheets.
